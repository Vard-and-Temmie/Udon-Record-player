## An interactive vinyl record player for vrchat
- Inspired by [Tanuki Tunes«É](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_033b9f75-49be-4213-9218-a540dd2be60a) world 
- You can visit [Example world](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_55ebe806-1918-4d4a-8202-7b98f142be81) to try it out by yourself
## Installation
1. Install the latest [VRCSDK3](https://vrchat.com/home/download), [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp) and [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo) packages
2. Import [Udon_Record_player.unitypackage](https://github.com/Vard-and-Temmie/Udon-Record-player/releases) to your unity project
3. Drag USharpVideo(if you dont have one already) and Record_Player prefabs into your scene
4. Drag "USharpVideo" and "Internals" gameobjects to fields with the same names in Record_Player gameobject ![image](https://i.imgur.com/dnRKF2u.png)

6. Done!

## How to add your own vinyl records?
1. First of all you need to make a texture of your vinyl. We provided Example.PSD in Example vinyls folder to make it easier for you <3
2. Create material with your texture (we recommend duplicating one of the example vinyl materials cause they have PBR maps for more realistic look)
3. Drop one of the ExampleVinyl prefabs into scene and change its material and name to your own
4. Increase array size of `Vinyl_list` and `Vinyl_url` in Record_Player gameobject by 1 and apply your new vinyl gameobject and url to them ![image](https://i.imgur.com/ID4zMny.png)
5. Done!
## Tips
- We recommend you locking your USharpVideo player by default for public worlds to prevent chaos of constantly changing music by random users.
- Also you can easily personalize player look by just changing albedo color in material settings. ![image](https://i.imgur.com/GRcwUHi.png)
## Additional information
This is our first prefab and it probably has bugs which we didn't notice, so please if you find out one - contact Vard#2766. Also we pretty shure we have plenty of misspells in this document because english is not our native language, if you find out misspells contact about that too!
