## How to add you own vinyl records?
1. First of all you need to make a texture of your vinyl. We provided Example.PSD in Example vinyls folder to make it easier for you <3
2. Create material with your texture (we recommend duplicating one of the example vinyl materials cause they have PBR maps for more realistic look)
3. Drop one of the ExampleVinyl prefabs into scene and change its material and name(optional btw)
